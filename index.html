<h3>Glossary</h3>

COBRA(n): 13th century Mallu word meaning co-brother. Also a kind of snake("paampu"). Paampu is also an extremely inebriated contortionist. Now don't picture COBRAs in your head as a bunch of coiled up snakes! Those are rattlers, you morons! 
Note: The easiest way to get over ESMEC is to get a life. But no one does it so you won't do it either. That's why we exist. That's why we'll flourish. And that's why we'll keep getting Likes!
