<h1>Welcome to Velangadan's website</h1>
<div>
  I know it looks hopelessly bad at the moment, but I promise you - 
  I'll be back & do something about the look & feel of this site. <br>
  I know there are tons of templates are available but I prefer a DIY approach! <br>
  My site, my choices. Right?

  <h2>A quick about me</h2>
  A curious cat, an eager beaver. <br>
  I'm a science & engineering graduate and a software engineer by profession. <br>
  I have a lifelong passion for learning, experimenting & experiencing things. <br>
  Outside of STEM, I have an active interest in endurance sports, filmmaking, art, writing & dancing.<br>
